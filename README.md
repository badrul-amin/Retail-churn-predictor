# Retail Member Churn Predictor

> An end-to-end machine learning project predicting customer churn for retail businesses, from raw transaction data to a live deployed web app.

##  Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the costliest problems in retail. This project builds a complete churn prediction pipeline using real transaction data to help identifying which customers are at risk of lapsing so retention campaigns can be targeted effectively.

Four models were trained in increasing order of complexity : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to let the data determine which approach fits best, rather than assuming upfront. **XGBoost was selected for deployment with a ROC-AUC of 0.74**, though Logistic Regression achieved a comparable result with far greater interpretability.

##  Business Problem

> *"Which of our members are likely to stop purchasing in the next 90 days?"*

Instead of manually reviewing thousands of customer records, this model scores every customer with a churn probability and risk tier thus enabling the marketing team to act proactively.

- **Period:** December 2010 – December 2011
- **Customers:** 4,338 unique members (3,317 in the model's observation window)

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
Removed cancellations (negative quantity), zero-price entries, and rows with missing CustomerID, reducing noise from 541K to 397K rows.

### 2. Feature Engineering — RFM
Built 3 features per customer from the **observation window (Dec 2010 – Aug 2011)**:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Recency** | Days since last purchase |
| **Frequency** | Number of unique purchase dates |
| **Monetary** | Total revenue generated |

### 3. Churn Labelling — Temporal Split
Defined churn using a **forward-looking prediction window (Sep – Dec 2011)**:
- Customers with **no purchase in the prediction window = churned (1)**
This avoids data leakage, where features and labels come from different time periods.

> ⚠️ **Note on leakage:** An initial random split produced AUC = 1.0 (a red flag). Recency was computed from the same snapshot date used to define churn, so the model was reading the label directly from the feature. The temporal split corrects this.

### 4. Modelling — Four Models, Increasing Complexity

Rather than jumping straight to the most powerful algorithm, models were trained in order of complexity to let the results justify the final choice:

| # | Model | Decision Boundary | Interpretability |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Logistic Regression | Linear | High — direct coefficients |
| 2 | Decision Tree | Non-linear (if/else rules) | High — visualisable |
| 3 | Random Forest | Non-linear (ensemble vote) | Medium — feature importance |
| 4 | XGBoost | Non-linear (sequential boosting) | Medium — feature importance |

### 5. Model Comparison

| Model | ROC-AUC | Accuracy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.71 | ~67% | Strong linear baseline; highly interpretable |
| Decision Tree | ~0.68 | ~64% | Single tree overfits with only 3 features |
| Random Forest | ~0.70 | ~65% | Improves on single tree, still below XGBoost |
| **XGBoost** ✅ | **0.74** | **69%** | Best — captures non-linear recency threshold effects |

**XGBoost was selected for deployment**, but the gap to Logistic Regression is modest. In a business context where stakeholder trust and explainability matter more than a 3-point AUC gain, Logistic Regression remains a credible alternative. Its coefficients directly show that higher recency increases churn risk and higher frequency decreases it.

### 6. Feature Enrichment Experiment
Added 5 additional features (`avg_order_value`, `total_items`, `unique_products`, `avg_quantity`, `revenue_per_visit`). AUC improved marginally to 0.742. Decision: retained the simpler 3-feature RFM model for interpretability and cleaner deployment.

##  Key Findings

- **41.2% churn rate** in the dataset is substantial enough to justify a retention programme
- **Recency is the strongest predictor** across all 4 models where customers inactive for 90+ days have significantly elevated churn risk
- **Logistic Regression performed competitively** (AUC 0.71) with full interpretability via its coefficients, a viable simpler alternative depending on business priorities
- **XGBoost generalises best** (AUC 0.74) by capturing the non-linear jump in churn risk around the 90-day recency threshold
- A simple three-feature RFM model outperformed more complex feature engineering, with additional features providing only marginal gains.
